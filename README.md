# Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Web Development Learning Repository**! ðŸš€

This repository will serve as a showcase of my journey through web development, from mastering the basics to building more complex, portfolio-worthy projects. It is designed to document my progress, challenges, and achievements as I grow as a developer.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Smaller Challenges & Mini Projects**: Iâ€™ll start by solving smaller challenges to sharpen my skills and understanding of core web development concepts.
- **Intermediate Projects**: These will include more involved projects where I apply what I've learned, ranging from interactive websites to API integrations.
- **Portfolio-Worthy Applications**: As I progress, I'll be working on larger, full-scale applications that will showcase my abilities and be part of my developer portfolio.

## Why I'm Doing This
I believe in the power of learning by doing. This repository will not only help me track my progress but also provide potential employers and collaborators a look at my growth and commitment to becoming a skilled web developer.

Feel free to follow along, offer feedback, or collaborate with me on future projects!
